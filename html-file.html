          <h2> 	What Makes Music Musical? </h2>
            <p>
              It’s music to my ears.
              That’s not music, 
              it’s noise.
              Turn down that noise!
            </p>
            <p>
              What is music? How do we know what’s musical and what’s not? 
              Why is music music to some ears and noise to others? 
              Everyone thinks they know music when they hear it, 
              but few can say exactly what it is and why. 
              If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of a command like “turn down that noise,” 
              you know how slippery ideas about music can be.
            </p>         
          <h3> Few have succeeded in truly defining music.</h3>
            <p>
              Imposing a single definition on all of the world’s music is difficult because people’s 
              opinions differ about what music is and what is musical. Many scholars of “world music” study 
              behaviors and sounds that are not considered to be “music” by the people who make it—the 
              chanting of the Koran, for instance. It’s our job to figure out a way of studying music 
              that makes sense to the people who make it. Rather than trying to come up with a definition of 
              music, we look for a concept of music that works for the culture we study. Here are a few that are 
              likely to work for any music.

          <h3> Music is a form of communication.</h3>
            <p>
              Music has much in common with language, and the two are almost inseparable as ingredients in popular song, 
              opera, and other musical forms. The relationship between music and language has been an important part of 
              the human musical experience since prehistoric times.  
            </p>
          <h3> Music is difficult to describe in nonmusical means</h3>

          <h2> Many music lovers insist that music is best appreciated if;</h2>
            <p>
              we do not define it, analyze it, or expect it to communicate anything at all. So what does music have to tell us? Why study music? 
              Music offers a record of history and human experience that words and images cannot. This record is especially important in 
              nonliterate societies, or in cultures where colonization, war, and social rupture have interrupted the transmission of written history.
